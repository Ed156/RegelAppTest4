This is a stripped down version of a production app that reproduces a crash when compiling for Release en running it in an IOS simulator. The crash happens early, just after the slash appears.
I created this test because the release version also crashes in testflight.

In Debug mode there are no issues.

The blazor part is taken of a template Blazor Hybrid app.
